    <h1>The Rise of Jude Bellingham</h1>
    <p>Born in Birmingham, Jude Bellingham rose through the ranks at St. Andrew’s, dazzling with skill beyond his years.  
      At just 16, he became Birmingham City's youngest ever first-team player, catching the eyes of Europe’s elite.  
      Borussia Dortmund secured his signature, and in Germany, he thrived, mastering midfield battles with maturity.  
      Champions League nights saw him shine, his fearless displays earning global admiration.  
      England called, and he became a Three Lions star, bossing midfields on the biggest stages.  
      Real Madrid came knocking, and in 2023, the Bernabéu became his new home.  
      Draped in white, he dominated La Liga, scoring goals and dictating play like a veteran.  
      El Clásico glory and Champions League heroics cemented his status among football’s greats.  
      From Birmingham’s streets to Madrid’s grandeur, he became the world's most complete midfielder.  
      And with every game, Jude Bellingham’s legend continues to grow.</p>

    <h1>The Hillsborough Tragedy</h1>
    <ul>
     <li>On April 15, 1989, thousands of Liverpool fans traveled to Hillsborough Stadium for an FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest.</li>
      <li>Due to poor crowd control and a failure to manage entry points, fans were funneled into already overcrowded pens.</li>
      <li>A deadly crush unfolded as people were trapped against metal fences, unable to escape the growing pressure.</li>
      <li>Police and emergency services failed to react properly, worsening the tragedy as 97 innocent fans lost their lives.</li>
      <li>Authorities falsely blamed supporters, leading to decades of pain and a long battle for justice by victims’ families.</li>
      <li>In 2016, an inquest ruled the deaths as unlawful killings, proving the disaster was caused by police negligence.</li>
      <li>Hillsborough remains a symbol of both devastating loss and the relentless fight for truth and accountability.</li>

    <h1>The Eiffel Tower</h1>
    <h3><p>The Eiffel Tower was designed by Gustave Eiffel for the 1889 Exposition Universelle (World’s Fair) in Paris.
      It was built to celebrate 100 years of the French Revolution and showcase modern engineering.
      Standing 330 meters (1,083 feet) tall, it was the tallest man-made structure until 1930.
      Construction took two years, two months, and five days, using 18,038 iron pieces and 2.5 million rivets.
      Initially, many Parisians, including Guy de Maupassant, disliked it and called it an “iron monstrosity.”
      It was originally meant to be dismantled after 20 years, but its use as a radio transmission station saved it.
      During World War II, the French cut its lift cables to prevent German forces from easily accessing the top.
      Hitler reportedly ordered it to be demolished, but his command was never carried out.
      Over time, the Eiffel Tower became a symbol of Paris and a major tourist attraction.
      It is repainted every seven years with 60 tons of paint to protect it from rust.
      Since 1985, sparkling lights have illuminated it every evening, adding to its charm.
      The tower attracts over seven million visitors annually, making it one of the most-visited monuments.
      It has inspired countless artists, photographers, and filmmakers worldwide.
      The structure consists of three levels, with restaurants and observation decks offering stunning views.
      It was initially brown but later painted its iconic “Eiffel Tower Brown” shade.
      On special occasions, the tower is lit in different colors to celebrate global events.
      It played a role in early radio transmission and later helped in the development of television signals.
      The Eiffel Tower has withstood wars, protests, and criticism, emerging stronger each time.
      Today, it remains an architectural marvel and a timeless symbol of France’s innovation and culture.</p></h3>
